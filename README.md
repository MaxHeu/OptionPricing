# Option Pricing

This project is a presentation on option pricing, complemented by a Jupyter Notebook in Python. The notebook serves as an interactive tool to illustrate key formulas, experiment with model parameters, and explore more advanced pricing techniques.

## Overview 
The project covers:

Fundamentals of options: calls and puts
Pricing models: Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo simulations, Jump-Diffusion and more
Limitations and challenges of standard models
Interactive visualizations to analyze parameter effects on option pricing

## Interactive notebook

option_pricing.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook with Python implementations and interactive experiments

## Summary 

This project provides both theoretical insights and hands-on experimentation with option pricing models. Whether you're new to options or looking to dive deeper, the interactive notebook allows for an engaging learning experience!
